# How can I add a rule to a decision table?

  TBA:
   - How can I add a row above / below an existing row?
   - How can I can add a row at the bottom of the table in a single click?

# How can I remove a rule in a decision table?

# How can I add an input or output to a decision table?

  TBA:
   - How can I add a cause left / right to an existing one?
   - Should it be possible to add a new clause at the end in a single
click? If true, how would it work?
   - How does the user get visual feedback about which parts of the
clause are mandatory to be filled in (validation)?

# How can I remove an input / output in a decision table?

# How can I define the name of a clause?

   Note: the name has no "execution meaning" but allows the user to
understand which data is used by this clause

# How can I define an input expression for a clause?

   Note: the input expression is the techincal expression (like
Expression Language) which extracts the value against which this clause
is tested from the input data.

   TBA:
     - Should the input expression always be visible? (Given that it is
a "technical" property yet mandatory for execution?)
     - How can I add a very "long" input expression? (Given that it may
be any script...)
     - How can can I define the expression / script language of the
expression (Javascript, Groovy ...)

# How can I define an item definition?

   TBA:
     - How can I define the datatype (string vs. integer ...)
     - How can I provide "allowed values"?

# How can I define the property name of an output clause?

   Note: this is the "techinical" variable name to which the output of
the given clause is assigned in the output result.
   This is required because a rule may have multiple output clauses and
there needs to be a way to specify a technical property name to a given
output in the result.

   TBA:
    - Should it be always visible? (Given that it is a "technical"
property yet mandatory for execution?)

# How can I provide input / output Entry values of a clause?

   TBA:
    - How can I provide a value in a "free text" way?
    - How can I choose from a list of allowed values?
    - How do I get feedback that the current value is invalid?

   TBA Later:
    - How can I add an  operator before the value? How can I add
multiple operators and /or ranges?
